# Data selection technique

Select a delimitered list
```sql
-- For string less than or equal to 4000 bytes
SELECT LISTAGG (DUMMY, ', ' ) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY DUMMY) AS RESULT
FROM (SELECT * FROM DUAL UNION ALL SELECT * FROM DUAL);

-- For string larger than 4000 bytes and can use RTRIM
SELECT RTRIM(XMLAGG(XMLELEMENT(
	E,
	DUMMY,
	', '
).EXTRACT('//text()') ORDER BY DUMMY).GetClobVal(), ', ') AS RESULT
FROM (SELECT * FROM DUAL UNION ALL SELECT * FROM DUAL);

-- For string larger than 4000 bytes and cannot use RTRIM
SELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(XMLAGG(XMLELEMENT(
	E,
	DUMMY,
	' AND '
).EXTRACT('//text()') ORDER BY DUMMY).GetClobVal(), ' AND $', '') AS RESULT
FROM (SELECT * FROM DUAL UNION ALL SELECT * FROM DUAL);
```

# Retrieving  database schema

Find table primary key and their respective columns
```sql
SELECT CONS.OWNER, CONS.STATUS, COLS.TABLE_NAME, COLS.COLUMN_NAME, COLS.POSITION
FROM ALL_CONSTRAINTS CONS INNER JOIN ALL_CONS_COLUMNS COLS
	ON CONS.OWNER = COLS.OWNER AND CONS.CONSTRAINT_NAME = COLS.CONSTRAINT_NAME
WHERE CONS.OWNER = USER AND CONS.CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'P' AND COLS.TABLE_NAME LIKE UPPER('%')
ORDER BY CONS.OWNER, COLS.TABLE_NAME, COLS.POSITION;
```

Find table indexes and their respective columns
```sql
SELECT IDXS.OWNER, COLS.TABLE_NAME, IDXS.INDEX_NAME, IDXS.UNIQUENESS, COLS.COLUMN_NAME, COLS.COLUMN_POSITION, COLS.DESCEND
FROM ALL_INDEXES IDXS INNER JOIN ALL_IND_COLUMNS COLS ON IDXS.OWNER = COLS.INDEX_OWNER AND IDXS.INDEX_NAME = COLS.INDEX_NAME
WHERE IDXS.OWNER = USER AND COLS.TABLE_NAME LIKE UPPER('%')
ORDER BY IDXS.OWNER, COLS.TABLE_NAME, IDXS.INDEX_NAME, COLS.COLUMN_POSITION;
```
