For PHP 5.4.11
============================================================
Download the binary ZIP file (EG. php-5.4.11-Win32-VC9-x86.zip)

Make sure Visual C++ 2008 Runtime has been installed if the PHP binary is compiled with VC9 compiled

Unzip the files to installation location such as d:\php54

Prepare php.ini file by copying the chosen template (php.ini-development or php.ini-production) to new name php.ini

If necessary, edit the php.ini to load PHP extensions
	Set the extension directory. Full path is needed if Apache HTTP Server will link against the PHP
		extension_dir = "d:\php54\ext"
	Uncomment the PHP extensions that will be used, EG:
		extension=php_mbstring.dll
		extension=php_mysqli.dll

Check if the modules can be loaded without Apache HTTP Server
	D:\php54\php.exe -m

After Apache HTTP Server has been linked with PHP, create a HTML page to dump the phpinfo()
	<?php phpinfo(); ?>
